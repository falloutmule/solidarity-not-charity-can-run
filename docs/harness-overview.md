# Harness overview

SNC Can Run uses **in-browser self-checks** (`window.CR`) plus a **Playwright** driver that loads root **`index.html`** and collects proofs.

**Gameplay baseline:** `BUILD_ID` `streetread1` — see `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for cache-busted Play / self-check URLs.

## In-browser (`window.CR`)

- Functions like `CR.runLayoutSelfCheck()`, `CR.runFullSelfCheck()`, `CR.runStreetReadabilityMinimapSelfCheck()`, `CR.runBuildingScalePolishSelfCheck()`, `CR.runLevelSelectorSelfCheck()`, `CR.runEarlyDistrictProgressionSelfCheck()`, `CR.runStreetBlockLevelSelfCheck()`, `CR.runD1ParkLandmarkSelfCheck()`, `CR.runOnboardingSelfCheck()`, `CR.runSoundFeedbackSelfCheck()`, `CR.runVisualReadabilitySelfCheck()`, `CR.runVisualRectangleRegressionSelfCheck()`, `CR.runDecorativePropsSelfCheck()`, `CR.runOptionsCleanupSelfCheck()`, `CR.runHallSelfCheck()`, etc.
- URL: `?selfcheck=1` runs full check and shows PASS/FAIL overlay.
- **`crWithTemporaryState`** — snapshots public state + `localStorage`, runs harness, restores so benchmarks do not leak.
- **`__crRuntimeErrors`** — uncaught errors fail runtime-clean checks.

## Playwright

- **`tests/run_selfcheck_playwright.js`** — launches browser, runs section checks, writes JSON proofs to repo root.
- Run: `node tests/run_selfcheck_playwright.js`
- Summary: **`proof-playwright-summary.json`** at repo root when harness runs (`pass: true` required for ship). Archived copies: **`reports/proofs/current/`**.

## Other gates

- **No external request check** — game must not depend on network assets at runtime.
- **Console / page errors** — captured during Playwright runs.
- **Release artifact check** — validates root `index.html` structure policy.

## Why Travis should not manually re-verify harness-green work

If Playwright and self-check proofs pass on the **same commit** as the Pages `?v=` URL, manual confirmation adds little unless the task is **device-specific** (real phone GPU, touch quirks) or **deployment** (Pages cache). Report the proof paths instead.
